# Audit workflow

7-phase process for auditing and updating an existing doc-based skill in this repo against its upstream documentation source. Includes a mandatory user approval gate before applying any changes.

**Pre-requisite:** Load `quality-standards.md` and `source-map.md` before starting this workflow.

---

## Phase 0: Pre-flight + classify source type

Before starting an audit, do two things.

### 0a. Verify the docs cache

Check that `.titanium-docs/` exists at the repo root. If missing, stop and prompt the user with:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/tidev/titanium-docs.git .titanium-docs
```

If present, optionally refresh:

```bash
cd .titanium-docs && git pull --ff-only && cd ..
```

Note the latest commit hash (e.g. `git -C .titanium-docs rev-parse --short HEAD`) so the audit report can record which upstream version it was compared against.

### 0b. Classify the skill's source type

| Source type | Skills | Audit approach |
|---|---|---|
| **Narrative** | `alloy-guides`, `alloy-howtos`, `ti-guides`, `ti-howtos` | Compare reference files against official guide subdirectories |
| **API** | `ti-api` | Compare against generated `.md` files in `.titanium-docs/docs/api/` |

The source type determines audit strategy:

- **Narrative**: Direct section-by-section comparison.
- **API**: Compare per-namespace; expect some references to map to many small upstream files.

---

## Phase 1: Coverage analysis

Map the current state of the skill against its upstream documentation.

### AUDIT-SKIP files

Before doing coverage analysis, scan all reference files in the skill for an `<!-- AUDIT-SKIP -->` HTML comment near the top. Files marked with this comment are manually maintained against a different upstream source (e.g. a third-party toolkit's own docs) and must be **excluded from the audit entirely**:

- Do NOT read or compare the file against any upstream `tidev/titanium-docs` source.
- Do NOT include the file in the coverage table.
- List skipped files in a separate "Skipped (manually maintained)" section of the report.
- Source-map.md should also flag these files; cross-check both signals.

If you propose any change to an AUDIT-SKIP file, that is a bug in the audit. Stop and ask the user before continuing.

### Steps

1. **Identify the source subtree** for the skill from `source-map.md`.
2. **List all files in both locations:**
   - Official docs: `Glob` the source subtree
   - Skill references: `Glob` the skill's `references/` directory
   - **Filter out AUDIT-SKIP files** (see above) — exclude them from all later phases.
3. **Read the skill's `SKILL.md`** to understand its quick reference table and overall structure.
4. **Generate a coverage table:**

   | Reference file | Official source file(s) | Ref lines | Source lines | Coverage estimate |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | `CONTROLLERS.md` | `Alloy_Controllers.md` | 380 | 520 | ~70% |
   | `MODELS.md` | `Alloy_Models.md` | 450 | 680 | ~65% |

### Output

Present the coverage table to the user. Note any reference files that have no clear official source mapping — these may be author additions or curated content.

---

## Phase 2: Gap identification

Compare each reference file against its upstream source in detail.

> **Use parallel agents for this phase.** Each reference file comparison is independent.

### Per-reference comparison steps

For each reference file:

1. **Read the reference file** completely.
2. **Read the corresponding official source file(s)** completely.
3. **Compare section by section.** For each section in the official docs:
   - Mark as **complete** (exists in reference with equivalent detail)
   - Mark as **partial** (exists but missing subsections, examples, or options)
   - Mark as **missing** (not covered at all)
   - Mark as **author addition** (exists in reference but NOT in official docs)
4. **Check code examples:**
   - Are all official examples present in the reference?
   - Are reference examples accurate (not hallucinated)?
   - Are examples updated to ES6+ style?
5. **Classify content without an official source.** Not all unlabeled content is training-data contamination. Distinguish three cases:
   - **Training-data contamination** (propose DELETE): methods/properties that don't exist in the SDK, wrong parameter names, overly generic advice, patterns from other frameworks (React, Vue, Cordova).
   - **Legitimate author contribution** (propose PRESERVE + MARK): verifiable real-world patterns, workarounds for known SDK bugs, best practices from production apps. Propose moving these into a `## Community-Discovered Patterns` section — never silently delete.
   - **Ambiguous** (propose ASK): cannot verify either way. Flag for user decision.
6. **Respect the `## Community-Discovered Patterns` convention.** Sections under this H2 heading are PROTECTED — never delete during audits, even without official source. See `quality-standards.md` § "Protected sections".

### Output per reference

```markdown
### CONTROLLERS.md

| Official section | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Controller lifecycle | Complete | |
| Event handling | Partial | Missing `removeEventListener` cleanup pattern |
| Conditional code | Complete | |
| Passing arguments | Missing | Not covered at all |

**Author additions (not in official docs):**
- ES6+ migration tips section — valid enhancement, keep

**Suspected training-data content:**
- `$.args.getProperty()` method — does not exist in SDK, REMOVE
```

---

## Phase 3: Consolidated report

Aggregate all per-reference findings into a single report.

### Report structure

```markdown
## Audit report: <skill-name>

**Compared against:** `tidev/titanium-docs@<commit-hash>`

### Overall health
- **References audited:** X of Y
- **Average coverage:** XX%
- **Critical gaps:** X sections completely missing
- **Training-data contamination:** X instances found

### Priority fixes (must fix)
1. [reference] Section X — completely missing, covers core functionality
2. [reference] Method Y — hallucinated, does not exist in SDK

### Recommended updates (should fix)
1. [reference] Section X — partial, missing Z examples
2. [reference] Code examples — need ES6+ update

### Low priority (nice to have)
1. [reference] Could add cross-reference to related skill
2. [reference] Platform-specific warning for Android

### Author additions to preserve
1. [reference] Section X — valid enhancement beyond official docs

### Estimated effort
- Full rewrite of X references
- Targeted updates to Y references
- Total reference files to modify: Z
```

---

## Phase 4: User approval gate

> **STOP. Do NOT proceed past this phase without explicit user approval.**

### Present to the user

1. The consolidated report from Phase 3.
2. Ask: *"Should I proceed with these updates? You can also:"*
   - Adjust priorities
   - Skip certain references
   - Request full rewrite vs targeted edits for specific files
   - Add additional items you've noticed

### Wait for one of

- **"Proceed"** / **"Go ahead"** / **"Aplica"** — Continue to Phase 5
- **"Skip X"** — Remove items from the update list
- **"Rewrite X"** — Force full rewrite of specific references
- **"Cancel"** — Stop the audit; the report can stay as a notes file for future reference

---

## Phase 5: Apply updates

Execute the approved changes from Phase 4.

### Decision: rewrite vs targeted edit

For each reference file, decide the approach:

| Condition | Approach |
|---|---|
| Coverage < 50% or heavy contamination | **Full rewrite** — re-read source, write from scratch |
| Coverage 50–80% with clear gaps | **Targeted additions** — add missing sections, fix errors |
| Coverage > 80% with minor gaps | **Targeted edits** — small additions and corrections |
| Training-data contamination found | **Full rewrite** of affected sections at minimum |

### Applying updates

> **Use parallel agents for this phase.** Each reference file update is independent.

For each reference file being updated:

1. **Re-read the official source** — never write from memory of Phase 2.
2. **Apply the changes** based on the approach:
   - **Full rewrite**: Use the `Write` tool to replace the entire file.
   - **Targeted additions**: Use the `Edit` tool to add sections.
   - **Targeted edits**: Use the `Edit` tool for specific corrections.
3. **Preserve author additions** flagged in Phase 2 (unless the user said to remove them).
4. **Apply quality standards** from `quality-standards.md`:
   - ES6+ code style
   - No dead URLs
   - English only
   - Practical code examples

### Preservation rules

When updating references, preserve:

- **Author additions** marked as valid in Phase 2
- **Cross-references** to other references in the skill
- **Platform-specific warnings** (even if not in official docs)
- **ES6+ style updates** already applied to examples

When updating references, remove or fix:

- **Training-data contamination** (hallucinated methods, wrong parameters)
- **Dead URLs** (`docs.appcelerator.com`, etc.)
- **Duplicate content** (same info in multiple sections)
- **Outdated patterns** (`var`, `Ti.include`, etc.)

---

## Phase 6: Post-audit verification

Verify the updates are correct and complete.

### Steps

1. **Spot-check** — read 2–3 updated reference files and verify:
   - New content matches official source
   - No new hallucinations introduced
   - ES6+ style maintained
   - Author additions preserved where flagged

2. **Verify `SKILL.md`** — does the quick reference table still match the reference files?
   - Were any reference files added or removed?
   - Does the description still accurately reflect the skill's scope?

3. **Check file sizes:**
   ```bash
   wc -l skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
   wc -l skills/<skill-name>/references/*.md
   ```
   - `SKILL.md` should be under 500 lines.
   - References should be under 800 lines each.

4. **Verify no orphaned content** — grep for references to removed or renamed sections.

---

## Phase 6.5: Cross-reference validation (MANDATORY when content moved between refs)

Whenever Phase 5 moves a section from one reference to another, splits one ref into two, or renames a section heading, run **every** check below. The classic failure mode is a stale `(./other-ref.md#anchor)` link to a heading slug that no longer exists in the target file.

This phase is **non-negotiable** when any of these happened during Phase 5:

- A `##` or `###` heading was deleted, renamed, or moved to a different file
- A reference file was renamed, split, or created from scratch
- A reference file was effectively "stubbed" (full content replaced by a short pointer)

### The 5 checks

For each moved/renamed/stubbed section `<X>`:

1. **Grep for residual content of `<X>` in every other ref of the same skill:**
   ```bash
   grep -rln "<command-name-or-distinctive-phrase>" skills/<skill-name>/ \
     | grep -v "<destination-file>"
   ```
   Classify each hit as **cross-reference** (link or one-line mention — keep), **workflow invocation** (uses the API/command but doesn't document it — keep), or **duplicate documentation** (same content lives in two places — fix by deleting the older copy and replacing it with a link to the destination).

2. **List every anchor link that targets the modified file:**
   ```bash
   grep -rnE "<modified-file>\.md#[a-z0-9-]+" skills/<skill-name>/
   ```

3. **List every heading still present in the modified file:**
   ```bash
   grep -nE "^(## |### )" skills/<skill-name>/references/<modified-file>.md
   ```
   GitHub-flavored markdown slugs are: lowercase, spaces → `-`, drop backticks/punctuation. Example: ``## `Alloy.Collections` API`` → `#alloycollections-api`.

4. **Validate each anchor against the slug list from step 3.** Any link whose anchor is not in the slug list is **broken** — repoint to the new heading, or to a more appropriate ref entirely if the content moved cross-file.

5. **Verify `SKILL.md`'s quick reference table** lists every current `references/*.md` file, with descriptions that match the file's actual content (not the pre-restructure scope). Cross-check anchors in `SKILL.md` against the same slug list from step 3.

### Output

```markdown
### Cross-reference validation: <skill-name>
- Residual content grep: __ refs touched, __ classified as cross-reference, __ classified as duplicate (fixed)
- Anchors entering modified files: __ total, __ valid, __ broken (fixed: list paths)
- SKILL.md quick reference table: in sync / drift (description: …)
```

A clean output is `0 broken anchors, 0 duplicates, table in sync`. Anything else must be fixed before declaring the audit done — **broken anchors are silently wrong** (Markdown renders the link but it jumps nowhere) and will not surface in `wc -l`, the spot-check, or any compiler.

### Why this phase exists

When Phase 5 splits one ref into two, or replaces a long section with a short pointer to a sibling ref, the audit's *external* comparison (skill vs upstream docs) stays green even if the *internal* cross-refs broke. Past audits closed with anchors like `cli-commands.md#some-old-anchor-form` left behind because the section heading slug had changed during the restructure. Phase 6.5 makes the internal cross-ref pass explicit and unmissable.

---

### Remind the user

- One commit per audited skill: `audit(<skill>): align refs with titanium-docs <date or commit>`.
- Mention the upstream commit hash from Phase 0a in the commit body or PR description.
- If changes are substantial, surface them in the PR description so reviewers see the diff context.
- If Phase 6.5 fixed any broken anchors, call them out in the commit body so a reviewer can sanity-check the new link targets.
